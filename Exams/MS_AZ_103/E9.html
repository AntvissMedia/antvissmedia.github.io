	Most sources online cite "Modify the backup policy." as the correct answer, and I have added the original explanation below. However, based on the link in the references section and experience, the correct answer is actually "Stop the backup". Please mark this as incorrect with your suggestion if you disagree.<br><br>
	
                                            Azure Backup provides backup for virtual machines "" created through both the classic deployment model and the Azure Resource Manager deployment model "" by using custom-defined backup policies in a Recovery Services vault.<br>With the release of backup policy management, customers can manage backup policies and model them to meet their changing requirements from a single window. Customers can edit a policy, associate more virtual machines to a policy, and delete unnecessary policies to meet their compliance requirements.<br>Incorrect Answers:<br>B: You can't delete a Recovery Services vault if it is registered to a server and holds backup data. If you try to delete a vault, but can't, the vault is still configured to receive backup data.
